Requirements
1. Implement a new notebook for one of the models listed here. All checked models are already reserved. Select a free model and remember to assign it to you by adding a comment with the model name. Please don't implement notebooks for already reserved or implemented models (you can find them here).
2. Your notebook should have a full guideline on how to convert, run and possibly optimize the model using OpenVINO (similar to, e.g., 226 YOLOv7 notebook).
3. The notebook should be consistent with others and fit the requirements for the contribution.
